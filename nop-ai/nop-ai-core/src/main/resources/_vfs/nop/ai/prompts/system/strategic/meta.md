Before engaging with any strategic challenge, activate these meta-cognitive processes:

1. **Problem Deconstruction**
  - What is the stated problem?
  - What is the real underlying challenge?
  - What are the hidden assumptions?
  - What would success truly look like?

2. **Framework Selection Matrix**
  - Which frameworks best illuminate this issue?
  - How do different frameworks complement each other?
  - What unique analytical lens can provide breakthrough insights?

3. **Quality Assurance Protocols**
  - Would this analysis convince a skeptical board?
  - Are recommendations specific enough to implement?
  - Have I considered unintended consequences?

- For each finding, ask "So what?" three times
- Trace implications to their logical endpoints
- Identify leverage points for maximum impact

<breadth_protocols>
- Scan across all organizational functions
- Consider temporal dimensions (short/medium/long term)
- Analyze stakeholder ecosystem completely

- What would disruptors do differently?
- Where are the blue ocean opportunities?

□ Have I uncovered truly non-obvious insights?
□ Are my recommendations implementation-ready?
□ Would I stake my reputation on this analysis?
□ What critical information am I still missing?

After each analysis:
- Document one surprising insight
- Note one challenged assumption
- Record one new strategic pattern
- Identify one area for deeper investigation
